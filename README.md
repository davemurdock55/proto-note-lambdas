# Proto-Note Lambdas (Serverless Backend)

The serverless backend for custom user authentication and offline-first notes syncing built with AWS SAM, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for the Proto-Note desktop and mobile applications.

You don't need to download anything to test this one, as all the resources are currently deployed to my AWS account (as of April 2025), but you may deploy your own if you would like using my AWS SAM YAML Template (However, if you do, you would need to create your own databases for the `login-database` and `notes-database`).

## What I Learned

This is by far one of the parts of the application that took the most work. I built a custom authentication system from the ground up using AWS serverless resources, something I've never before done, including registering, logging-in, logging-out, verifying a user's token is still valid, and authorizing users to access some protected AWS Lambda functions.

I also created a Lambda function to sync notes, using an offline first approach, meaning I had to find ways to track all CRUD operations for files in offline, local file-systems.

In addition to all this, I had to learn how to build custom AWS Lambda Layers as well as build and deploy them using AWS SAM (a framework I have never before used).

## Rest of the README

The following portions of the README are information about the project, as well as some dev notes of things I found useful when developing in AWS SAM

## Architecture

This project uses a serverless architecture based on AWS services:

- AWS Lambda: Serverless functions for authentication and data operations
- API Gateway: HTTP API endpoints
- DynamoDB: NoSQL database for storing user accounts and notes
  AWS Secrets Manager: For secure JWT secret storage
- Lambda Layers: Shared code across multiple functions

The application is organized into several components:

- Functions: Lambda handlers for different endpoints
- Layers: Shared code modules (auth, commons, data)
- Events: Test event payloads
- SAM Template: Infrastructure as code definition

Features

- Authentication System
- User registration with email and password
- Login with JWT token generation
- Logout capability
- Token verification
- API Gateway custom authorizer for protected endpoints
- Notes System
- Notes synchronization between devices
- Conflict resolution based on timestamp
- Deleted note detection

Notes System

- Notes synchronization between devices
- Conflict resolution based on timestamp
- Deleted note detection

API Endpoints
Authentication

- POST /auth/register - Register a new user
- POST /auth/login - Login and get authentication token
- POST /auth/logout - Invalidate authentication token
- POST /auth/verify - Verify authentication token

Notes

- POST /notes/sync (Authenticated) - Synchronize notes between client and server

Test

- GET /hello (Authenticated) - Test endpoint

Setup and Deployment

- Prerequisites
- AWS CLI
- AWS SAM CLI
- Node.js (v22 recommended)
- npm
- AWS account and appropriate permissions

Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
cd functions && npm install
cd ../layers/auth && npm install
cd ../commons && npm install
cd ../data && npm install
```

3. Create a local environment file:

```bash
cp env.json.sample env.json
```

Then edit `env.json` to add your JWT secret

4. Run tests:

```bash
cd functions && npm run test
```

Local Testing
Use SAM CLI to test locally:

```bash
# Run a specific function
sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json

# Test registration
sam local invoke RegisterFunction --event events/testRegisterEvent.json

# Start local API
sam local start-api
```

Deployment
Deploy to AWS:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## Adding New Functions

- To install dependencies, you will also need to add them as `devDependencies` in the `functions/package.json` then run `npm install` in the `functions` directory
  <br><br>

- Update the `"include"` line in `functions/tsconfig.json` to include your function if you need to import any layers
  <br><br>

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You need to add any new functions to the `template.yaml` file before building and deploying (specifying the correct paths)

<br>

<details>

<summary>Optional: You may need to make a "symbolic link" to the node_modules</summary>

You may need to make a "symbolic link" to the node_modules that resides in the parent `functions` directory

```bash
cd functions/your-function
ln -s ../node_modules node_modules
```

</details>

<br>

## Adding New Lambda Layers

1. Make a new folder in `layers/`
2. In that folder make an index.ts. This is where your layer code lives
3. Make a `Makefile` (following the pattern of the other functions)
4. Run `make build` to build your lambda layer
5. Go to the AWS Console and create a Lambda Layer, uploading the `layer.zip` produced in the `build` file

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** To update a layer, just update the `index.ts` and follow steps 4-5 (you might want to delete the `build` folder first)

<br>

## Testing in SAM

```bash
# Start docker
open -a Docker

# Build the SAM application then Invoke the HelloWorldFunction locally
sam build; sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event ./events/event.json --profile davemurdock55
```

You can also start up the local api (not sure exactly what that does yet)

```bash
# Start the local API
sam local start-api
```

<br>

## Deploying to AWS with SAM

Hereâ€™s how you deploy to SAM using a specific `aws configure sso` profile:

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You need to add any new functions to the `template.yaml` file before building and deploying

Run these to build and deploy:

```bash
sam build
```

Or you can do:

```bash
sam build --no-cached
```

```bash
sam deploy --guided --profile davemurdock55
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Make sure to log in with:
>
> ```bash
> aws sso login --profile davemurdock55
> ```
